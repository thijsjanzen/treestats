# B2 metric

Balance metric that uses the Shannon-Wiener statistic of information
content. The b2 measure is given by the sum over the depths of all tips,
divided by \\2^{d}\\, e.g. \\\sum d_i / 2^{d_i}\\ Although also defined
on non-binary trees, the treestats package only provides code for binary
trees.

## Usage

``` r
b2(phy, normalization = "none")
```

## Arguments

- phy:

  phylo object or ltable

- normalization:

  "none" or "yule", when "yule" is chosen, the statistic is divided by
  the Yule expectation, following from theorem 3.7 in Bienvenu 2020.

## Value

Maximum depth (in number of edges)
