#' Normalized LTT statistic
#' @description The nLTT statistic calculates the sum of
#' absolute differences in the number of lineages over time, where both the
#' number of lineages and the time are normalized. The number of lineages is
#' normalized by the number of extant tips, whereas the time is normalized by
#' the crown age. The nLTT can only be calculated for reconstructed trees.
#' Only use the treestats version if you are very certain
#' about the input data, and are certain that performing nLTT is valid (e.g.
#' your tree is ultrametric etc). If you are less certain, use the nLTT function
#' from the nLTT package.

#' Reference nLTT statistic
#' @description The base nLTT statistic can be used as a semi stand-alone
#' statistic for phylogenetic trees. However, please note that although this
#' provides a nice way of checking the power of the nLTT statistic without
#' directly comparing two trees, the nLTT_base statistic is not a substitute
#' for directly comparing two phylogenetic trees. E.g. one would perhaps
#' naively assume that \eqn{nLTT(A, B) = |nLTT(A, base) - nLTT(B, base)}.
#' Indeed, in some cases this may hold true (when, for instance, all normalized
#' lineages of A are less than all normalized lineages of B), but once the
#' nLTT curve of A intersects the nLTT curve of B, this no longer applies.
