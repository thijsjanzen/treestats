#' Mean I statistic.
#' @description The mean I value is defined for all nodes with at least 4 tips
#' connected, such that different topologies can be formed. Then, for each node,
#' I = (nm - nt/2) / (nt - 1 - nt/2), where nt is the total number of tips
#' descending from that node, nm is the daughter branch leading to most tips,
#' and nt/2 is the minimum size of the maximum branch, rounded up. Following
#' Purvis et al 2002, we perform a correction on I, where we correct I for
#' odd nt, such that I' = I * (nt - 1) / nt. This correction ensures that I
#' is independent of nt. We report the mean value across all I' (again,
#' following Purvis et al. 2002).
#' @param phy phylo object or ltable
#' @return average I value across all nodes
