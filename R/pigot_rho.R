#' Pigot's rho
#' @param phy phylo object
#' @return rho
#' @description Calculates the change in rate between the first half and the
#' second half of the extant phylogeny. Rho = (r2 - r1) / (r1 + r2), where r
#' reflects the rate in either the first or second half. The rate within a half
#' is given by (log(n2) - log(n1) / t, where n2 is the number of lineages at the
#' end of the half, and n1 the number of lineages at the start of the half. Rho
#' varies between -1 and 1, with a 0 indicating a constant rate across the
#' phylogeny, a rho < 0 indicating a slow down and a rho > 0 indicating a speed
#' up of speciation. In contrast to the Gamma statistic, Pigot's rho is not
#' sensitive to tree size.
