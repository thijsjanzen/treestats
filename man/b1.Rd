\usage{
b1(phy, normalization = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{phylo object or ltable}

\item{normalization}{"none" or "tips", in which case the resulting
statistic is divided by the number of tips in the tree, as a crude way of
normalization.}
}
\value{
B1 statistic
}
\description{
Balance metric (in the case of a binary tree), which measures
the sum across all internal nodes of one over the maximum depth of all
attached tips to that node.
Although also defined on non-binary trees, the treestats package only
provides code for binary trees.
