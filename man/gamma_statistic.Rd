gamma statistic

\description{
The gamma statistic measures the relative position of
internal nodes within a reconstructed phylogeny. Under the Yule process,
the gamma values of a reconstructed tree follow a standard normal
distribution. If gamma > 0, the nodes are located more towards the tips of
the tree, and if gamma < 0, the nodes are located more towards the root of
the tree. Only available for ultrametric trees.
}
\examples{
simulated_tree <- ape::rphylo(n = 10, birth = 1, death = 0)
gamma_statistic(simulated_tree) # should be around 0.
if (requireNamespace("DDD")) {
  ddd_tree <- DDD::dd_sim(pars = c(1, 0, 10), age = 7)$tes
  gamma_statistic(ddd_tree) # because of diversity dependence, should be < 0
}
