\title{Maximum closeness}
\usage{
max_closeness(phy, weight = TRUE, normalization = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{phylo object or ltable}

\item{weight}{if TRUE, uses branch lengths.}

\item{normalization}{"none" or "tips", in which case an arbitrary post-hoc
correction is performed by dividing by the expectation of n log(n), where n
is the number of tips.}
}
\value{
Maximum Closeness
}
\description{
Closeness is defined as 1 / Farness, where Farness is the sum
of distances from a node to all the other nodes in the tree. Here, we return
the node with maximum closeness.
