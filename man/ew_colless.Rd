\title{Fast function using C++ to calculate the equal weights Colless index of
(im)balance.}
\usage{
ew_colless(phy)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{phylo object or ltable}
}
\value{
colless index
}
\description{
The equal weights Colless index is calculated as the sum of
\eqn{abs(L - R) / (L + R - 2)} over all nodes where L + R > 2,
where L (or R) is the number of extant tips associated with the L (or R)
daughter branch at that node.  Maximal imbalance is associated with a value
of 1.0. The ew_colless index is not sensitive to tree size.
}
\examples{
simulated_tree <- ape::rphylo(n = 10, birth = 1, death = 0)
balanced_tree <- treestats::create_fully_balanced_tree(simulated_tree)
unbalanced_tree <- treestats::create_fully_unbalanced_tree(simulated_tree)
ew_colless(balanced_tree)
ew_colless(unbalanced_tree) # should be higher
