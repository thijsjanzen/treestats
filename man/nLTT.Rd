\title{Normalized LTT statistic}
\usage{
nLTT(phy, ref_tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{phylo object or ltable}

\item{ref_tree}{reference tree to compare with (should be same type as phy)}
}
\value{
number of lineages
}
\description{
The nLTT statistic calculates the sum of
absolute differences in the number of lineages over time, where both the
number of lineages and the time are normalized. The number of lineages is
normalized by the number of extant tips, whereas the time is normalized by
the crown age. The nLTT can only be calculated for reconstructed trees.
Only use the treestats version if you are very certain
about the input data, and are certain that performing nLTT is valid (e.g.
your tree is ultrametric etc). If you are less certain, use the nLTT function
from the nLTT package.

simulated_tree <- ape::rphylo(n = 10, birth = 1, death = 0)
reference_tree <- ape::rphylo(n = 10, birth = 0.2, death = 0)
nLTT(simulated_tree, reference_tree)
nLTT(simulated_tree, simulated_tree) # should be zero.
