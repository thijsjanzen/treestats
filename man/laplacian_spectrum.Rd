list with five components: 1) eigenvalues the vector of eigen
values, 2) principal_eigenvalue the largest eigenvalueof the spectral
density distribution 3) asymmetry the skewness of the spectral density
distribution 4) peak_height the largest y-axis valueof the spectral
density distribution and 5) eigengap theposition ofthe largest
difference between eigenvalues, giving the number of modalities in the tree.

\description{
Computes the distribution of eigenvalues for the modified graph
Laplacian of a phylogenetic tree, and several summary statistics of this
distribution. The modified graph Laplacian of a phylogeny is given by the
difference between its' distance matrix (e.g. all pairwise distances between
all nodes), and the degree matrix (e.g. the diagonal matrix where each
diagonal element represents the sum of branch lengths to all other nodes).
Each row of the modified graph Laplacian sums to zero. For a tree with n
tips, there are N = 2n-1 nodes, and hence the modified graph Laplacian is
represented by a N x N matrix. Where RPANDA relies on the package igraph to
calculate the modified graph Laplacian, the treestats package uses C++ to
directly calculate the different entries in the matrix. This makes the
treestats implementation slightly faster, although the bulk of computation
occurs in estimating the eigen values, using the function eigen from base.
